The problem of minimizing functionals with constraints arises, for example, in the task of kinematic fitting.
% \begin{block}{Kinematic fitting}
\begin{itemize}
\item Tracking detectors provide the coordinates of the triggered sensitive elements along with their errors;
\item Track-finding involves fitting the particle trajectories to these coordinates;
\item Sometimes, when the reaction channel is known, the additional information on kinematics could be utilized in terms of
% \begin{description}
\item[conservation laws:] $\sum E_\mathrm{initial} = \sum E_\mathrm{final}$, $\displaystyle\sum\vec{P}_\mathrm{initial} = \sum\vec{P}_\mathrm{final}$;
\item[missing mass:] $\displaystyle\left|\sum\boldsymbol{P}^{(4)}_\mathrm{initial} - \sum\boldsymbol{P}^{(4)}_\mathrm{final}\right|^2 = M_X^2$;
\end{itemize}

% \end{description}
This is called \emph{kinematic fitting}.
